# Start From Nowhere: build roadmap

Updated August 19, 2026. Owner: Hunter Roberts. Builder: Claude sessions. This file is the working schedule; each week's block ships as one or more merged PRs. Dates are targets, not promises; anything user-facing ships only after the browser test suite passes.

## Comparative advantage (the why-us, revisited each cycle)

1. Game-grade engagement on top of real per-skill analytics. Competitors have one or the other, not both.
2. Radical honesty: original items, sourced statistics, no fabricated testimonials or efficacy claims, transparent methodology everywhere. Trust is the moat an institutional audience actually pays for.
3. The rankings-to-study loop: pick target schools, get a study plan calibrated to their published numbers, watch fit improve as ratings rise. No competitor closes this loop.
4. Speed: solo-operator economics with AI-scale content production, so the bank, blog, and features compound weekly.
